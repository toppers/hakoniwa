### Topics & Events

- Hakoniwa WG holds "Mokumoku-kai" irregularly, which is open to the public via connpass and attended by the development members of Hakoniwa WG.
  - https://hakoniwa.connpass.com/
  - "Mokumoku" means "to do something quietly by oneself," and "kai" means "meeting." So, "mokumoku-kai" is generally a meetup to study, work, read, etc., casually and alone. In Hakoniwa WG, we bring up what we want to do or want to know, express it with light self-introductions, and after a short period of "mokumoku," share the progress.
  - If you have heard about Hakoniwa at various events and are curious about it, or if you are just curious about Unity x ROS aside from Hakoniwa, please join us. There is no specific schedule, so those who want to chat with the development team members are welcome to join us.
- We contribute a series of articles to "[MONOist](https://monoist.atmarkit.co.jp/)," an information portal for manufacturing specialists.  
In the series titled "[Recommendations for Embedded Development in the Cloud Age Using Virtual Environments](https://monoist.atmarkit.co.jp/mn/series/23683/)," we introduce the future of IoT system development while interweaving Hakoniwa's activities. Please take a look.
