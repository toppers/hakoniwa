#### Hakoniwa Forum: Technical questions and discussions

We maintain [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/toppers/hakoniwa/discussions) as a social networking site for developers, engineers, and users involved in Hakoniwa.

In trying out the [Hakoniwa prototype model](https://toppers.github.io/hakoniwa/prototypes/), we welcome technical questions (even those related to underlying technologies, such as Athrill, of course), as well as ideas on how to utilize Hakoniwa and related general topics are also welcome.

The following categories are available; please choose the appropriate one and submit your entry.

- [Announcements](https://github.com/toppers/hakoniwa/discussions/categories/announcements): What's new from Hakoniwa members
- [General](https://github.com/toppers/hakoniwa/discussions/categories/general): General topics about Hakoniwa and underlying technology, a.k.a. chatting place.
- [Idea&Request](https://github.com/toppers/hakoniwa/discussions/categories/idea-request): Can I use it like this? I want to use it like this! Let's share ideas!
- [Inquiry](https://github.com/toppers/hakoniwa/discussions/categories/inquiry): Inquiries and requests for participation in Hakoniwa WG activities (for technical questions, please use "Q&A")
- [Q&A](https://github.com/toppers/hakoniwa/discussions/categories/q-a): Technical questions (questions about individual technology elements, including Athrill, are also welcome! (Please let us know about any problems you encountered during the trial of the Hakoniwa prototype model)

#### Hakoniwa mokumoku-kai: Developing Hakoniwa and chatting.

Hakoniwa WG holds "Mokumoku-kai" irregularly, which is open to the public via connpass and attended by the development members of Hakoniwa WG.  
https://hakoniwa.connpass.com/

"Mokumoku" means "to do something quietly by oneself," and "kai" means "meeting." So, "mokumoku-kai" is generally a meetup to study, work, read, etc., casually and alone. In Hakoniwa WG, we bring up what we want to do or want to know, express it with light self-introductions, and after a short period of "mokumoku," share the progress. 

If you have heard about Hakoniwa at various events and are curious about it, or if you are just curious about Unity x ROS aside from Hakoniwa, please join us. There is no specific schedule, so those who want to chat with the development team members are welcome to join us.
