Our goal is to establish a **simulation environment and ecosystem** for engineers who develop/provide massive and complex IoT systems.

{{< image src="/img/docs/aimat1.en.png" width="700" >}}

Hakoniwa's target is an information system with various devices connected by a network.
We envision IoT applications in various fields, such as autonomous driving, logistics, and space development.

Hakoniwa targets the following users
- System developers: engineers who develop IoT systems and their components
- Service providers: Engineers who promote the provision of system services using the IoT.
- Developers and providers of Hakoniwa assets
  - Assets here refer to the system components of Hakoniwa.

The strength and novelty of the Hakoniwa project is the ability to verify the target system with **arbitrary accuracy** by linking the Hakoniwa Asset.
Then, according to technical domain and evaluation target, users can replace the Hakoniwa assets and verify them at any **target / abstraction level / accuracy**.
