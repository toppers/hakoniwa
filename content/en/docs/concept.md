The concept of Hakoniwa is **"Put mixed things as you like, and try various things with ease !"**

We provide a virtual environment, which makes it easy to combine and demonstrate different software and services when developing IoT, automated driving systems, cloud robotics systems, etc.

We envision a use scenario where engineers from diverse fields gather to develop IoT systems.        
The "box" simulates the events and states of complex federated IoT systems according to the desired scenario.
And, by just replacing the "assets" that are the system components of Hakoniwa, the user can arbitrarily change the validation's target/abstraction level /accuracy.

For your information, the origin of Hakoniwa is one of the traditional Japanese cultures in which various elements such as small trees, dolls, bridges, and boats are arranged in a miniature garden in a small box to recreate a picturesque scene.
