Also, we believe that the following functional characteristics are essential for Hakoniwa's core functions.
1. Componentization
2. Visualization
3. Event Driven
4. Automation

The core functions and functional characteristics of Hakoniwa are still under design study in the WG while developing the [prototype model](/hakoniwa/prototypes/).
We will add more details as we progress.
