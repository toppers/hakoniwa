Hokoniwa WG is working on "big goals, little by little."

Our current main activity is to create [prototype models](/hakoniwa/en/prototypes) to realize the concept and to examine the technology.
All of these R&D results are released as OSS.
We desire continuous maturation of the core technologies and expansion of the various functions of Hakoniwa by sharing each prototype model and receiving feedback on it.

The Hakoniwa Project is engaged in research and development, first constructing and disseminating educational packages and then expanding into product development.
We have a big vision, but to be honest, we are somewhat short on the workforce.
We are looking for various technical personnel (especially those with knowledge of cloud technologies and visualization asset development) to help us grow Hakoniwa.

If you agree with the aims and objectives of Hokoniwa WG, we welcome your participation. 
We have monthly online meetings and biannual technical review camps.
In addition, we continuously discuss, share and develop information using Slack, GitHub, and Google Drive.

If you would like to participate in discussions on Slack, request our activities, join in the development of core technologies and assets, utilize the technical results of the activities of the Hokoniwa WG, or develop products, please get in touch with us at [contact information](/hakoniwa/en/contact/).
