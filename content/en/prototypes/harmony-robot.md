This is a Hakoniwa prototype model for integration of cloud computing and robotics.

### Design intent from a technical study perspective

- Study of specific methods of cloud computing integration
- Study on how to coordinate with other robots (challenge to more complex robot operation/interference)
- Study of mechanisms to augment Hakoniwa assets

### Other design intent

- Interaction with RDBOX ( establish a track record of Hakoniwa as a development virtual environment)
- Promote Hakoniwa to the RDBOX user base (PR activities)
